    :description: Configure the Arista CloudVision integration for Splunk On-Call.

CloudVision is Aristaâ€™s modern, multi-domain management platform that leverages cloud networking principles to deliver a simplified NetOps experience. Unlike traditional domain-specific management solutions, CloudVision enables zero-touch network operations with consistent operations enterprise-wide, helping to break down the complexity of siloed management approaches.

This integration is compatible with the following versions of Splunk On-Call:

- Starter

Type the receiver's name in the :guilabel:`Receiver Name` field and click the :guilabel:`Add Configuration` drop-down menu.  

Select the :guilabel:`VictorOps` option in the following table, including the :guilabel:`routing key` you would like to notify in Splunk On-Call.
